# Branch: Master

#### Centralized Workflow

1. Make sure that both partners have the ability to push directly to your main repository.
2. All changes are pushed to Master directly.

#### Contributor Forking

1. The partner who owns the repository does not give their partner any permissions for the repository.
2. To work on the code, their partner must fork and clone the repository.
3. When their partner wants to push changes to Github they must push the changes to their forked repository and submit a pull request.
4. The partner who owns the repository must accept the pull request to have the changed merged into the master repository.

#### Feature Branching

1. Make sure that both parters have the ability to push directly to your main repository.
2. For each task create a well named feature branch to commit your changes.
3. When the changes are done and working the branch is merged into master.
